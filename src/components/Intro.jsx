                Hi, I'm L Phansalkar, a passionate, driven, collaborative, creative human being who is up-and-coming in the tech world.
                <p></p>
                I am passionate about accessibility and socio-political equity through technology. I entered the public education sector ten years ago with a belief that this was the best way to reach disenfranchised populations for early psycho-education intervention. However, after the mass and disproportionate impact of COVID, I quickly realized this was no longer the case. As schools and mental health counseling moved online, so too did I. 
                <p></p>
                I chose to develop my skills a software engineer as it was a natural fit with my creativity and drive to be an agent of widespread social change. 
                <p></p>
                I graduated from Fullstack Academy (Grace Hopper), having completed 553 hours over a 13-week intensive JavaScript full stack coding program.
                <p></p>
                I hope to collaborate on and build these impactful web apps, as well as implement my empathy and humor to help build office community.
                <p></p>
                I am currently looking for full stack and/or backend software engineer opportunities.
                <p></p>
